# My Projects for the Introduction to Computer Engineering Courses

Hello! I'm studying Computer Engineering at Bogazici University. This repository includes the projects I implemented during my first-year. 

## CMPE 150 - [Introduction to Computing](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe150)
For the Cmpe 150 course, I implemented two projects.
* ASCII Atari Like Game is the first [project](First-Project-ASCII_Atari_Like_Game).
* A Night In A Crime Scene is the second [project](Quick-Sort-A_Night_In_A_Crime_Scene) where I implemented a Quick-Sort algorithm.
  
## CMPE 160 - [Introduction to Object Oriented Programming](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe160)
* Communication Simulation is the first OOP [project](OOP-Communication_Simulation).
* Port Simulation is the second OOP [project](OOP-Port_Simulation).
* Market Simulation is the last OOP [project](OOP-Market_Simulation) for this course.
