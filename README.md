# My Projects for the Introduction to Computer Engineering Courses

Hello! I'm studying Computer Engineering at Bogazici University. This repository includes the projects I implemented during my first year. 

## CMPE 150 - [Introduction to Computing](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe150)
For the Cmpe 150 course, I implemented two projects.
* ASCII Atari Like Game is the first [project](First-Project-ASCII_Atari_Like_Game).
* A Night In A Crime Scene is the second [project](Quick-Sort-A_Night_In_A_Crime_Scene) where I implemented a Quick-Sort algorithm. In this project, my goal is to help a detective at the crime scene collect as valuable evidence as possible according to the following limitations: Each piece of evidence has an id,​​ weight,​ evidence value, and collection time, representing the time required to collect the evidence without ruining it. Also, the detective's pockets have a limit of carrying maximum ​​weight. All of this information is given in the input. The detective has to collect as valuable evidence as possible before he runs out of the given time and without exceeding the weight limit. The algorithm calculates the possibly best subset of evidence to maximize the total evidence value and prints the resulting subset.
  
## CMPE 160 - [Introduction to Object Oriented Programming](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe160)
* Communication Simulation is the first OOP [project](OOP-Communication_Simulation).
* Port Simulation is the second OOP [project](OOP-Port_Simulation).
* Market Simulation is the last OOP [project](OOP-Market_Simulation) for this course.
